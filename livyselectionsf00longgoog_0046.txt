Quirites a Curibus appellati. Monumentum eius pugnae,
ubi primum ex profunda emersus palude equus Curtium
in vado statuit, Curtium lacum appellarunt.

e Ex bello tam tristi laeta repente pax cariores Sabinas
viris ac· parentibus et ante omnes Romulo ipsi fecit.
Itaque, cum populum in curias triginta divideret, nomina

7 earum curiis imposuit. Id non traditur, cum haud dubie
aliquanto numerus maior hoc mulierum fuerit, aetate
an dignitatibus suis virorumve an sorte lectae sint, quae

8 nomina curiis darent. Eodem tempore et centuriae tres
equitum conscriptae sunt: Ramnenses ab Romulo, ab
T. Tatio Titienses appellati ; Lucerum nominis et originis
causa· incerta est. Inde non modo commune sed con-
cors etiam regnum duobus regibus fuit.

6 XV. Haec ferme Romulo regnante domi militiaeque
gesta, quorum nihil absonum 'fidei divinae originis
divinitatisque post mortem creditae fuit, non animus

in regno avito recuperando, non condendae urbis consi-

6. tristi lacta: note the con-
trast. curias: civil divisions‚
formed theoretically of ventes related
by birth or customS‚ but scarcely
thirty in number at this early period.
The oldest popular assembly at
Rome was the comitia curiata.
nomina aarum: oi the curial
names that survive, some are
clearly derived from localities.
OtherS, however, suggest names of
women, and one, Rapta. is very
significant.

’1. Id: anticipatos the indir.
quest. hoc: i.e. than thirty.

8. centuriae: == centumviriae, a
division of one hundred men. Bam-
nenses etc.: the derivations given
are quite fanciful, but the Ramnes,
Tities, and Luceres represent the
most ancient patrician divisionS.
concors: their harmon10us reign
was after several years terminated
by the killing of Tatius by a moi),

because he had seemingly connived
at- the maltreatment of Laurentian
ambassadorS. Romulus as sole ruler
gained victories over two Etruscan
citieS‚ Fidenae and Veii.

XV.6-XV1. ESTIMATE OF
ROMULU& HIS DEIFIC'A-
TION.

Livy is here clearly conscious

of a tradition, perhaps republican
in oriqin, that Romulus became
tyrannical in his later years.
N o act os his was inconsistent
wuh his divine oriqin or his
alleyed deification after death.
The vision of Julius Proculus
support-3 the story os his trans-
lation.

XV. 6. fidei: dat. after absonum,
and followed by obj. gen. non
animus, etc.: amplifying quorum
nihil.
