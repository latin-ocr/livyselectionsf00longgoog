ΤΙΤΙ LIVI .

ΑΒ URBE CONDITA

PRAEFATIO.

Facturusne operae pretium sim, si a primordio urbis
res populi Romani perscripserim, nec satis scio, nec, si

2 sciam, dicere ausim, quippe qui cum veterem tum vul-

gatam esse rem videam, dum novi semper scriptores aut
in rebus certius aliquid adlaturos se aut scribendi arte

In this yeneral Preface Livy
sets forth his object from a patn-
otic and from a personal ’nt of
view in writinq a yenerffistory
(si a primordio . . . perscrip-
serim) of Rome. No state was
ever yreater, none richer in the
illustr-icus dequ of its mem yreed
tre mmmm „12 5352
from the cml-s of 122³ own day,
will first treat, carefree, the poetic
leyends and memorable deeris of
those earlier oyes. For the
render, there will be that whole-
some and profitable result that
comes from all θινός] of history-—
quidance to the best and a warn-
iny ayainst the worst, both for the

individual and his state.

ι. facturusne . . . timtind. quest.
after nec satis scic. Livy modestly
does not know whether the results
will be commensurate with his effort.
Many Latin sentences end met-

a rudem vetustatem superaturos credunt.

Utcumque erit,

rically. but this begins with four
feet ot a hexameter. operae: poss.
gem: with pretium. “worth the
while.” ιι sciam: eciam in a possi-
ble fut. condition. instead ot the
more natural contrary to fact, as in
Cicero's letters, Fam. 8. 9. 1; 15. 1.
ausim: archaic for ausus sim.

2. quippe qui: either quippe, or
ut (cf. 4 below), often introduces a
causal relative clause in Livy. novi⁴
semper scriptores: '‘new histor-
ians‚ constantly arising.” terl-
bendi arte: “style of composition.”
contrasted with in rebus, “subject
matter.” ⁴

8. memoriae: dat. with con-
suluisse. It separates the rather
awkward group or genitive& pro
virili parte: “to the best of my
ability.” et ipsum: “myselr as
well” as the novi ecriptores: et is
frequently so used with ipse in
Livy. pointing to other actions or
persons, officient: the indic. is

Ι modestly kept.
