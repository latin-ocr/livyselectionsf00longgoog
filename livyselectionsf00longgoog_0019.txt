L. Calpurnius Piso, Q. >Claudius QuadrigariuS, Valerius
Antias, O. Liciniusv Macer, Q. Aelius Tuber0, and Cn.
Gellius. With the exception of Quadrigarius, who
began with the Gallie invasion of 390 13.o., each of these
· writers began with the earliest period; Hemina con-
cluded his brief work of four books with the second
Punic war, while the others brought their work down
to contemporary events. N one of these histories has
come down to us, but ancient critics represent them
as varying much in style, and in the industry and trust-
worthiness of their authors Piso is used frequently by
Livy in books I and II, 'but there could have been little
in common between the warmth of Livy's narrative
and the severe simplicity of Piso's style. While he is
· mentioned *by name six timeS‚ he is nowhere spoken
of with any enthusiasm. To Quadrigarius and AntiaS,
to Macer and Tuber0, Livy was likewise indebted for
material in the first decade. Macer is expressly men-
tioned seven timeS, but only in the first decade. The
author whom Livy quotes most frequently throughout
his work is Antias. His name appears thirty-six timeS,
often in slighting references after Livy reaches periods
where he is able to detect the apparently willful fabrica-
tions in which the work of Antias abounded. In many
instances these various authors are cited only to be
rejected, and for this* reason we can not tell definitely
what source Livy follows when he has silently accepted
statements as facts. '

These imthe main were Livy's literary sources in the
first decade, though not all of these were used directly,
and none of them was used consistently throughout
any' portion of his work. The extent to which he was
dependent ‚upon a more or less fluid tradition for the
earlier periodS, where imagination, an indispensable gift
for any historian, has often rounded out the narrative,
