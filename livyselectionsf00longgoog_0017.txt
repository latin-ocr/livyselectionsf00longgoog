INTRODUCTION 13

Ages only by rare good fortune. Only thirty-five books,
I—X, XXI-XLV, have reached us. Less than a century
after Livy's death the poet Martial lightly complains
that his library does not afford room for so large a work:
Livius ‘loyen-3, quem mea non totum bibliotheca capit
(XIV, 190). Complete copies, however, were extant at
the beginning of the fifth century of our era, and appar-
ently for a century or two later; but as early as the
first half of the first century an abridgment, or Epitome,
was made for convenience, and from this Epitome, but
made at a much later date, we have outlines, or Peri-
ochae, giving brief summaries of the contents of each
book. From these Periochac, which exist for all bookS, ·
except the 136th and 137th, we learn the scope of the
whole work, and see how inestimably valuable it would
be should research ever bring the lost portions to light„
The character of the Periochac and some hint of the
interest of lost books may be seen -from the following:
Periocha Lib. XVI. Origo Carthaginiensium et pri-
mordia urbis eorum referuntur. Contra quos et Hieronem,
regem Syracusanorum, auxilium Mamertinis ferendum
senatus censuit, cum de ea re inter suadentes, ut id
fieret, dissuadentesque contentio fuisset; transgressisque
tunc primum mare exercitibus Romanis adversus Hie-
ronem saepius bene pugnatum. Petenti pax data est.
Lustrum a censoribus conditum; ‚censa sunt civium
capita ducenta octoginta duo milia ducenta triginta
quattuor. D. Iunius Brutus munus gladiatorium in
honorem defuncti patris primus edidit. Colonia Aesernia
deducta est. Res praeterea contra Poenos et Vulsinios

prospere gestas continet.
