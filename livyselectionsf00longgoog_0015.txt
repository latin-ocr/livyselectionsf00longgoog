daughter was the wife of a certain rhetorician, L. Magius.
Shortly after the death of Augustus (14 A. D.), when
'affairs at Rome began to grow worse under Tiberius,
Livy probably retired again to Patavium where his
independent spirit and republican sympathies sub-

great excitement throughout Europe over the discovery

to place upon it an inscription recounting the lasting
honor brought to Padua by her distinguished son, who was
“historicorum Latini nominis facile princep8.''

in a context which refers to the annales of his predecessors.

'The scope of Livy's work is implied in the statement
of the Preface, that while the writer is dealing with
