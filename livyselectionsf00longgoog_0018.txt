what the nation had already achieved, should be con-
spicuous in their earliest productioris. The first works
conceived in a national spirit were epic poems, the
Bellum Poenicum of Naevius and the Annales of EnniuS,
and in each of these, as the names would imply, the
historical clement strongly predominated. The first
history in prose was the Annales of Q. Fabius Pictor, a
writer whom Livy calls scriptorum antiquissimus. His
work, written in Greek because in his day no adequate
Latin prose had been developed, covered the history
of Rome from its founding until the close of the second
Punic war. Livy deservedly esteemed ’ Pictor as a
worthy authority (cf. 22. 7. 4.). The title Annales was
commonly used by earlier historians, and suggests that
their sources were in part the annual records kept by ’
the various sacred collegeS, such as those of the augurs
, and the pontiffs. The records of the pontiffs were them'-
selves called annales maximi. History based upon these
sources and arranged by years must obviously have
been meager in style, however trustworthy as to fact.
Contemporary events were naturally treated with greater
fullness, as in Pictor's account of the second Punic war,
in which he himself had fought. Other Annalists writ-
ing in Greek were L. Cincius Alimentus and C. Acilius ;
both of whose works Livy knew and used either directly
or indirectly.

The first historiari to use Latin prose was Cato the
Elder. His Oriyirae& to which Cicer0, de Sen. 38, makes
him refer with some pride, gave the early· history of
Rome and of other Italian cities as ·well and there was
added a history of the first and second Punic wars.
Cato departed somewhat from the annalistic treatment,
particularly in that he inserted speeches in his narrative.
Many Subsequent historians, however, went back to the
title of Annales, as in the case of L. Cassius Hemina,
